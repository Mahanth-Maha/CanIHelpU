Modeling the Idea of User (Self Assigned) Delivery App

## Basic Overview -(Idea) 

### Short Story <Emergence of idea>:	 
  
my relatives has gone to a village(Court) which is some what far from city . And they forget to eat and no hotels around, now they cant ignore court because they can call at anytime.
Fortunately a friend of friend of friend came forward to deliver the food for them (even though there are apps which delivers food , they do deliveries in certain range of city).  

I thought, *what if ?* there is an app which can help us in these situations. 
	(Hope my app serves this) 

## Generalizing the idea (THE PROBLEM STATEMENT) and including several funtionalities : 
	 
### BASIC IDEA of this app : 
		 
Assume A person (say Helper / HE) is travelling to place A to place D And there is a person (say Benificiary / BE) who wants something ( Packet / PK ) from place B to place C. 

```
If ( Place B and Place C are on the way from A to D) and (We visit in order A , B , C , D) :
  Then YOU CAN DELIVER THE Packet TO Benificiary. 
```

So that , BE got benifit and we can generate a tip from BE to HE , where even the HE got benifit , since it is on the way !  

## Advantages : 
### 1.	TO HELPER 

    Can get Money  
    Can use this as a part time job 
      

### 2.	TO BENIFICIARY 

    gets the work done 
    saves the time 
    saves the Effort / Energy 
    can get in-time (if it was an important thing :: applies) 
		 
### 3.	TO SOCIETY 
		 
    Social connections are improved with an intension of helping others. 

### 4.	TO ENVIRONMENT 
		 
    Reduces Pollution  
       (since we avoided BE to use vehicle for a round trip) 
       [even if BE uses an electric bike, 
             electricity from neuclear Power plant can be reduced in use.]
